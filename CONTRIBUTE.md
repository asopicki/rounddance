# Contribute

There are four ways to contribute to this repository

* Send a mail
* Open an issue
* Send a pull request
* Send a patch

which I will explain in more detail below.

## Mail


The easiest way to contribute is by sending a [mail](mailto:cuesheets@gmx.net "cuesheets@gmx.net") with your comments or
a cuesheet you would like to share. I will try to answer your request as soon as I can.

# Open an issue

You can open a [new issue](https://github.com/asopicki/rounddance/issues) through the Github interface though you need an account to
do that. State your problem in the issue or attach a file with the content you would like to share and I will review your request as soon as I can. By doing so on Github everyone with an account is able to contribute to this as well by adding comments.

## Send a pull request

The third (more technical) option is to use [Github](https://github.com) by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/asopicki/rounddance/pulls).
Reviewing and integrating your changes will be easier that way but you would need an account on [Github](https://github.com) for this.

## Send a patch

By far the advanced method for contribution is cloning the repository to your own computer and providing a patch by mail. You should choose this option if you are interested in regularly sharing content. Contact me by mail if you need help with this.

 Either of these methods work and your contribution is highly appreciated.
