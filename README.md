# Repository Content

This repository holds a few cue sheets written in Markdown format and may be distributed according to the [license](LICENSE.md) in the file [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

Additional a small [script](md2html.py) in the file [md2html.py](md2html.py) is included which will translate the cue sheets to HTML5 format. The script is written in Python and should work on Linux with Python 2.7 and the [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text-to-HTML conversion tool installed. It may work on Windows as well though this has not been tested.
